What did you build? -- I built an online fortune teller service. Given that "real" fortune tellers are all fake/random chance anyway, an online version is no different.

What language(s) or tools did you use? -- I used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Also, given the nature of the assignment, I used ChatGPT heaviy.

What did you do versus what AI helped with? -- AI gave me the basic idea for the project by suggesting a magic 8 ball while I built upon it with more fortune telling services. I built the original structure of the page while AI did all the CSS (given that's one of my weaknesses) and improoved it. AI also generated the responses to various fortune-related things on the pages because I generally lack creativity

What's one thing you're proud of? -- I'm proud of the fact that the website looks good, which I generally would've been unable to do without AI because CSS and design isn't one of my strongsuits.

What's one thing you'd improve with more time? -- With more time, I would've implemented an annoying AI voice to read fortunes and may have even implemented customized AI responses to each question for the 8 ball.
